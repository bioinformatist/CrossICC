#### Allocate new Samples   

CrossICC provide `predict()` function allowing users to obtaind the cluster number of the unclassified samples based on the result from the CrossICC object.
In this section ,users could perform prediction with the `CrossICC.object`. Note that, for new sample, it should contains all the features that used for prediction. 
that is, the feature from the CrossICC result. Otherwise, it will throw errors.
