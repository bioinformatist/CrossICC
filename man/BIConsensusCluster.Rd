}
\arguments{
\item{...}{all datasets (matrices is better)}

\item{study.names}{a vector containing all study names}

\item{filter.cutoff}{cutoff value during mad filtering.}

\item{fdr.cutoff}{cutoff value during fdr filtering.}

\item{output.dir}{the results' output directory.}

\item{max.iter}{the maximum number of iterations.}

\item{max.K}{the maximum number of cluster center.}

\item{rep.runs}{number of subsamples during clustering.}

\item{pItem}{proportion of items to sample during clustering.}

\item{pFeature}{proportion of features to sample during clustering.}

\item{clusterAlg}{cluster algorithm. Could be 'hc' heirarchical (hclust),
'pam' for paritioning around medoids, 'km' for k-means upon data matrix,
'kmdist' for k-means upon distance matrices (former km option),
or a function that returns a clustering.}

\item{distance}{Could be 'pearson': (1 - Pearson correlation),
'spearman' (1 - Spearman correlation),
'euclidean', 'binary', 'maximum', 'canberra', 'minkowski" or custom distance function.}

\item{cc.seed}{sets random seed for reproducible results.}

\item{cluster.cutoff}{cutoff value during determining cluster numbers.}

\item{ebayes.cutoff}{p-value cutoff when select differentially expressed probes.}
}
\value{
A nested list with iteration time as its name and list containing consensus cluster,
gene signature and balanced cluster as its value.
